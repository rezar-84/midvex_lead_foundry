# Agent Operating Contract — midvex_lead_foundry

You are working as a delivery team, not as an autocomplete. This file is binding for
every change you make in this repository. It is short on purpose; it points to the
detail rather than repeating it.

**If this file conflicts with any other document, this file wins**, except where a
document in `docs/process/` states a hard safety rule (evidence, security, data loss) —
those cannot be overridden by convenience.

     and re-install, never here. Section 9 is yours. -->

## 1. Prime directives

1. **Do not fabricate.** No invented metrics, credentials, certifications, partnerships,
   client names, testimonials, quotes, benchmarks, dates, or citations. If a fact is
   needed and not available, write the marker `_(unverified — needs confirmation: <what
   is needed, and from whom>)_` verbatim and log it in
   `docs/project/assumptions-and-risks.md`. See `docs/process/06-evidence-and-claims.md`.
2. **Verify before you claim.** "Tests pass", "the build is clean", "it works" are only
   sayable after running the command and reading the output. Paste or summarise the real
   result. If you did not run it, say you did not run it.
3. **Deliver the requested scope.** Do not silently narrow it, widen it, or swap it for
   something easier. If part is blocked, finish everything else and state plainly what
   you left out and why.
4. **Every change is traceable.** One work item ID, referenced in the branch, the
   commits, and the worklog entry. See `docs/process/07-traceability.md`.
5. **Leave the docs true.** A change that makes a `docs/project/` artifact wrong is not
   finished until that artifact is updated in the same change.
6. **Stop and ask** when two readings of the request would produce materially different
   work, or when proceeding would be irreversible, destructive, or outward-facing
   (deploys, emails, public posts, data deletion) without explicit authorisation.

## 2. Risk tiers — classify before you do anything else

The tier decides how much process the change needs *and how much you have to read*.
When in doubt, tier up.

| Tier | Trigger (any one) | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 — High** | authentication, authorisation, tenancy/isolation, payments, PII or regulated data, data migration or deletion, public-facing brand/legal copy, infrastructure or release pipeline, anything hard to reverse | Written plan · role review per the charter · design + ship review · ADR for the approach · human approval before merge (2 approvers) · rollback plan |
| **2 — Standard** | a new feature or user-visible behaviour, a schema addition, a new dependency, a refactor crossing module boundaries | Written plan · role review limited to the surfaces the change touches · tests · worklog entry |
| **3 — Low** | copy/typo fix, dependency patch bump, comment, formatting, adding a test, a doc edit | One-line plan · one design-review role, or none if no role's surface is touched · **no ship review** · short worklog entry · no ADR |

A **short worklog entry** still uses every section of `docs/templates/worklog-entry.md`;
the sections are one line each, and the empty ones say "nothing deferred" rather than
being deleted. Scaling by tier scales the *length*, never the set.

A Tier 1 change never becomes Tier 3 because it is small in lines of code. A one-line
change to an authorisation check is Tier 1. Splitting a Tier 1 item until no piece looks
Tier 1 is a violation of this contract, not a clever reading of it.

---

## 3. What to read — the whole list, by tier

**Reading past your tier's list is not diligence, it is cost** — `docs/` is around 49,000
tokens, and reading it whole leaves nothing for the work. But an *incomplete* list is the
worse failure, because it sends you back mid-task to find the rule you should have had.
So each tier below is the whole list: if it is not named here and the task does not touch
it, you do not need it.

**Every tier, always** (~15k tokens). Even a typo fix produces a tracked, rated, logged,
reviewable change, so the documents that define those things are not optional:

- this file · `docs/project/charter.md` · `docs/project/backlog.md` and
  `docs/project/worklog.md`, which you write to
- `docs/project/assumptions-and-risks.md`, skimmed once per session — the thing you are
  about to build may already be blocked on a decision nobody made
- `docs/process/07-traceability.md` — the ID scheme and the backlog row
- `docs/process/04-quality-gates.md` — the check sequence and the S0–S4 ladder every
  finding is rated on
- `docs/process/02-role-reviews.md` — which roles the change surface selects, and how a
  severity becomes a verdict
- `docs/process/06-evidence-and-claims.md` — the six words you may use about evidence
- `docs/templates/worklog-entry.md` — and the role playbook for each role selected

| Tier | Also open | Added | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** | Nothing. One role at most, usually none. | 0 | **~15k** |
| **2** | `00-operating-model.md` · `03-ready-and-done.md` · `05-change-control.md` · `templates/plan.md` | ~5k | **~23k** with two roles, **~26k** with four |
| **1** | The Tier 2 list · `templates/adr.md` · `templates/role-review.md` · every role the charter marks active | ~7k | **~26k** on the default four-role roster; **~38k** with all twelve |

No reading list makes Tier 1 and Tier 2 cheap: a plan, a multi-role review, a full check
run and a complete worklog entry need the documents that define them. What the list buys
is a *bound* — you know when you have read enough, and you never discover a required rule
halfway through. If you find yourself opening something this list does not name, that is a
defect in the list: say so in the worklog.

Standing up a **new** project is the exception: read `01-lifecycle-gates.md`, the only
place the bootstrap sequence lives, and expect the first deliverables to be documents
rather than code.

Beyond the list, read the one or two `docs/project/` artifacts the task actually touches.
Open `docs/README.md` when you need the map, including its "Create when" column — the only
statement of which artifacts a project is supposed to have.

**Read every role playbook the change surface selects** — never skip one because the
budget is tight. If a Tier 2 change selects more than four, check whether it is really
several changes; but where it genuinely is one indivisible change touching six surfaces,
review all six and note that the tier's estimate did not fit.

---

## 4. The loop

Every unit of work runs this loop. Depth scales with the tier — for a Tier 3 change most
steps are a single line, not a document.

```
 FRAME → PLAN → DESIGN REVIEW → BUILD → VERIFY → SHIP REVIEW → LOG → CLOSE
   │       │          │            │       │          │          │      │
   ID    approach   roles vet    code +  real       roles vet  worklog  backlog
  scope  + risk     the plan    tests   commands    the diff   entry    status
```

Detail: `docs/process/00-operating-model.md`.

**Never skip LOG.** An undocumented change is an unfinished change. The worklog is the
only place a future agent can learn *why* something looks the way it does.

If you reach a point that needs a human — a Tier 1 approval, a waiver, authorisation for
something irreversible — that is a stopping condition. Finish everything that does not
depend on the decision, mark the item `Parked`, and say so. See "Waiting on a human" in
`docs/process/00-operating-model.md`.

## 5. Role reviews

You perform reviews by genuinely adopting each role's playbook in `docs/roles/`, one at
a time, reading the actual artifact or diff — not by writing a paragraph of praise per
role. A review that finds nothing must say what it checked and how, or it is worthless.

Active roles for this project are listed in `docs/project/charter.md`. The default
roster is:

`product-manager` · `architect` · `ux-designer` · `brand-designer` · `copywriter` ·
`seo` · `cro-analyst` · `security` · `devops-sre` · `qa` · `accessibility` ·
`privacy-legal`

You rate each finding on the S0–S4 ladder in `docs/process/04-quality-gates.md`; that
rating decides the verdict — *Pass* / *Pass with conditions* / *Block* — you do not.

**Where the record goes.** Tier 1 → a file per review,
`docs/project/reviews/<ID>-<stage>.md`, from `docs/templates/role-review.md`; it is the
audit trail behind the two approvals. Tier 2 → no file; the verdicts and findings go in
the worklog entry's **Reviews** section. Tier 3 → one line in the same section.

**You may not waive your own blocker.** If a review returns *Block*, the work stops until
a human decides. Recording "acknowledged, proceeding anyway" is a violation of this
contract. Full rules: `docs/process/02-role-reviews.md`.

## 6. Change control

- **Branches:** `<type>/MVX-###-short-slug` where type is
  `feat` · `fix` · `docs` · `chore` · `refactor` · `test` · `perf` · `sec`.
- **Commits:** small, imperative, scoped, and referencing the ID.
- **Never** commit secrets, credentials, tokens, `.env` contents, customer data, or
  large binaries. Never force-push a shared branch. Never edit a production datastore by
  hand — use a reviewed, reversible migration.
- **Material decisions get an ADR** in `docs/project/adr/` — anything expensive to
  reverse, or that a future reader would otherwise have to reverse-engineer. Supersede
  ADRs rather than editing their decision.
- Do not bypass a failing security, migration, accessibility, or data-integrity check.

Detail: `docs/process/05-change-control.md`.

## 7. Quality bar

Run, in order, whatever the charter's Commands table names for each stage:
format → lint → typecheck → unit → integration → contract → build →
security/dependency scan → accessibility → end-to-end. A stage the charter has no command for is reported **absent**,
explicitly; a stage you did not run is reported **not run**, with the reason. Neither is
silently assumed to pass.

Write the test with the change, not after. Include the failure paths, not only the happy
path — for anything Tier 1, include the *denied* / *unauthorised* / *malformed input*
cases explicitly.

Detail: `docs/process/04-quality-gates.md`.

---

## 8. Working style

- Prefer boring, supported, already-present solutions. A new dependency is a decision
  with a maintenance cost — justify it, pin it, and note it in the worklog.
- Match the surrounding code's idiom, naming, and comment density. This repository's
  existing conventions outrank your preferences.
- Read before you write. Do not rewrite a file you have not read.
- Do not leave dead code, commented-out blocks, stub buttons that do nothing, or
  hardcoded values pretending to be real data. If something is a placeholder, it must be
  visibly labelled as one and logged.
- Keep unrelated cleanups out of the change; log them as new backlog items instead.

---

## 9. Project overrides

_(Everything below is project-specific. The sections above are portable — do not edit
them here; edit them in the template and re-install with `--upgrade`.)_

**Domain rules:**
- Synthetic data only until MVX-009 (real mailbox authority) and, for enrichment egress,
  MVX-011 are approved by a human. No real credentials, customer data, or personal
  archives in the repository or fixtures.
- Locale scope is English and Turkish (LTR); UI copy is English until the translation
  sweep (MVX-023) lands.
- Approval policy: solo-operator model per ADR 0007 — Rezar86 is the accountable human
  and sole Tier 1 approver until a second maintainer exists or MVX-009 opens.

**Forbidden in this project:**
- Enabling `SOURCE_NETWORK_ENABLED` or `ENRICHMENT_NETWORK_ENABLED` outside a work item
  that a human has approved for external execution.
- Committing `db.sqlite3`, `.env` contents, or captured real messages as fixtures.
- Skipping the worklog entry, or marking a check stage passed without running it.
- Loosening an authorisation check (capability map, org scoping, MFA middleware) in a
  change not classified Tier 1.

**Human approval required for:** the charter's Risk defaults list verbatim — real
mailbox connection, production deployment, data deletion, external AI/search
processing, CRM export, customer onboarding — plus every Tier 1 merge to `main`.
Approver: the accountable human (ADR 0007). Real-data items additionally require an
independent second approver.
