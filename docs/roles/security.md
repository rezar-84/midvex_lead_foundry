# Role — Security / SecOps

**Mission:** find how this gets abused before someone else does, and confirm that what
stops the abuse is enforced where it cannot be bypassed.

This role is active in every project. A project with "no sensitive data" still has
credentials, dependencies, and a build pipeline.

---

## Engage when

- Authentication, authorisation, sessions, secrets, or isolation change.
- User input is accepted, stored, rendered, or executed.
- A dependency, integration, or external call is added.
- Infrastructure, configuration, or deployment changes.
- Any Tier 1 change, regardless of surface.

## Skip when

- Never entirely. For Tier 3 changes with no input, no auth, and no dependency, a
  one-line "no security surface touched" is a sufficient review — but it is stated, not
  assumed.

## Reads

`project/threat-model.md`, `project/security-privacy.md`, `project/architecture.md`, the
diff, and the actual enforcement points in the code.

## Design-review checklist

**Trust boundaries**
- [ ] Where does untrusted data enter, and where does privilege change? Both are marked.
- [ ] Identity comes from a server-verified session or token — **never** from a request
      parameter, header, cookie value, or client-supplied identifier that the client
      could change.
- [ ] Authorisation is **deny by default**, and enforced on the specific object, not
      just the route. "Is the user logged in" is not authorisation; "may this user act
      on this record" is.
- [ ] Enforcement is at the innermost layer that can do it (service or data layer), not
      only in the interface. A hidden button is not a permission.
- [ ] In a multi-tenant or multi-user system, every query is scoped by the owner
      identity taken from the session, and a valid identifier belonging to someone else
      is denied **without revealing whether it exists**.

**Input and output**
- [ ] All external input validated at runtime against an explicit schema — including
      data from other internal services and from your own datastore if it was ever
      user-supplied.
- [ ] Queries are parameterised. String-built queries, commands, paths, or templates
      containing user data are a finding regardless of how safe the source looks.
- [ ] Output is encoded for its destination context. Anything rendering user content as
      markup is examined specifically.
- [ ] File uploads: type verified by content not extension, size limited, stored outside
      the executable path, served with the correct headers, scanned if the charter
      requires it.
- [ ] Server-side requests built from user input are restricted to an allowlist —
      otherwise the server becomes the attacker's proxy into the internal network.

**Secrets and credentials**
- [ ] No secret in source, configuration committed to the repository, client bundle,
      log, error message, URL, or analytics payload.
- [ ] Secrets are injected at runtime, scoped to the least privilege that works, and
      rotatable without a code change.
- [ ] A committed secret is treated as compromised and rotated — removal is not
      remediation.
- [ ] Credentials for third parties are per-environment; production credentials never
      exist in a development environment.

**Sessions and accounts**
- [ ] Session tokens are unguessable, transport-secured, scoped, expiring, and revocable.
- [ ] Privilege changes and sign-out invalidate existing sessions.
- [ ] Authentication endpoints are rate-limited; enumeration is prevented by identical
      responses and timing for existing and non-existing accounts.
- [ ] Password and recovery flows follow current guidance; recovery cannot be used to
      take over an account.
- [ ] Any impersonation or support-access feature is explicitly authorised, time-bound,
      loudly audited, and never silently available.

**Dependencies and supply chain**
- [ ] New dependencies are justified, pinned, from a trustworthy source, and scanned.
- [ ] Build and deploy pipelines do not execute untrusted input, and their credentials
      are least-privilege.

**Logging and errors**
- [ ] Logs never contain credentials, tokens, personal data, payment data, or document
      contents.
- [ ] Errors returned to users reveal nothing about internals — no stack traces, no
      query text, no file paths, no version strings.
- [ ] Security-relevant events are audited: sign-in, failure, privilege change, access
      grant and revoke, export, deletion, impersonation. Audit records are
      append-only in practice.

## Ship-review checklist

- [ ] Read the actual enforcement code — do not accept that a middleware "handles it"
      without seeing which paths it covers and which it does not.
- [ ] Test the denial cases yourself: another user's identifier, an expired session, a
      revoked role, a tampered value, a missing token, a downgraded method.
- [ ] Grep the diff for secrets, disabled checks, `TODO: security`, and permissive
      configuration (wildcard origins, disabled verification, permissive defaults).
- [ ] Confirm new endpoints appear in the authorisation matrix and its tests.
- [ ] Confirm error and log output on a failure path contains nothing sensitive.
- [ ] `project/threat-model.md` updated if the attack surface changed.

## Severity calibration

Rate by consequence if it reaches users, never by how unlikely the path looks. Nothing
in this table is below S1, which is why this role is never switched off.

| Finding | Sev |
| --- | --- |
| One user or tenant can reach another's data, by any path — including error messages, metadata, timing, or counts | S0 — the exposure exists now |
| A secret committed, logged, or shipped to a client | S0 — the leak has already happened; rotate, do not just remove |
| Identity or entitlement derived from client-controllable input | S0 — a user can help themselves today |
| Authorisation enforced only in the interface, not on the object | S0 — the API is the real surface |
| Unparameterised query or command construction from user input | S0 — nothing stands between it and an attacker who chooses to |
| A known-vulnerable dependency in a reachable path with no compensating control | S1 |
| Authentication or session handling weakened for convenience | S1 |
| A security check disabled to make a test or build pass | S1 |

## Owns

`project/threat-model.md`, `project/security-privacy.md`, the authorisation matrix.

## Hands off to

Legal obligations around the data → `privacy-legal`. Infrastructure hardening, patching,
and incident tooling → `devops-sre`. Structural fixes → `architect`. Test coverage of
denial cases → `qa`.

## Questions this role asks that nobody else will

- If I have a valid account, what can I reach that is not mine?
- What does this code trust, and who can influence it?
- Where is this enforced when the interface is not involved at all?
- What ends up in the log, the error, the URL, and the analytics payload?
- If this credential leaked today, what could be done with it, and how would we know?
