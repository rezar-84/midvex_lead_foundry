# Plan — MVX-### <title>

**Tier:** 1 | 2 | 3 **Depends on:** _(IDs, or none)_

## Problem

_(What is wrong or missing today, for whom, and what it costs them. Not the solution.)_

## Outcome

_(One sentence: what will be true afterwards that is not true now, stated observably.)_

## Approach

_(How. Concrete enough that someone else could implement it. Name the actual files,
modules, endpoints, tables, or screens.)_

## Alternatives rejected

| Option | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| _(the obvious one)_ | _(the real reason, not "not a good fit")_ |

## Affected surfaces

- **Code:** _(files/modules)_
- **Data:** _(schema, migrations, backfills)_
- **Contracts:** _(APIs, events, formats others depend on)_
- **Docs to update:** _(which `project/` artifacts this will falsify)_

## Failure modes

_(What happens when the dependency is down, the input is hostile, the list is empty, two
people act at once, the migration half-applies.)_

## Test strategy

- **Unit:** _(what)_
- **Integration:** _(what boundary)_
- **Negative cases:** _(what must be refused — required for Tier 1)_
- **Manual:** _(what automation cannot judge)_

## Rollback

_(How this is undone, and whether that has ever been done.)_

## Out of scope

_(What this deliberately does not do. Anything here that someone might expect gets a
backlog ID.)_

## Assumptions

_(Each one also goes in `project/assumptions-and-risks.md`.)_

## Review
