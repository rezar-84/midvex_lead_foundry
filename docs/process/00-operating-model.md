# 00 — Operating model

How an agent turns a request into shipped, documented, verified work.

---

## The loop

```
FRAME → PLAN → DESIGN REVIEW → BUILD → VERIFY → SHIP REVIEW → LOG → CLOSE
```

Each step below states its purpose, its output, and how it collapses for low-risk work.
Nothing is skipped; low-risk work simply produces a sentence where high-risk work
produces a document.

### 1. FRAME

Turn a request into a bounded unit of work.

- Restate the request in one sentence, in your own words. If your restatement and the
  request could plausibly mean different things, ask now — before planning, not after
  building.
- Assign or reuse a work item ID (`MVX-###`) and add it to
  `project/backlog.md`. A request that is really three tasks becomes three IDs.
- Classify the **risk tier** (see "Risk tiers" in `AGENTS.md`). This decides everything
  downstream, including how much of this document applies.
- Check `project/assumptions-and-risks.md` — the thing you are about to build may
  already be blocked on a decision nobody made.
- Check the Definition of Ready items marked **checkable at FRAME**
  (`03-ready-and-done.md`). The rest are gated at BUILD entry, because they depend on the
  plan you have not written yet.

**Output:** a backlog row with ID, one-line description, tier, owner role, dependencies,
and a status from the enum in `07-traceability.md`.

### 2. PLAN

Decide the approach before touching code.

- Read the existing implementation first. Most plans are wrong because they were written
  against an imagined codebase.
- State the approach, the files/areas affected, the data or contract changes, the test
  strategy, and the rollback story.
- Name the alternatives you rejected and why — one line each. This is what makes a plan
  reviewable rather than merely readable.
- List what you are *not* doing, so scope drift is visible.

**Output:** Tier 1 → `project/plans/MVX-###.md` from `templates/plan.md`.
Tier 2 → the same content, inline in the response. Tier 3 → one sentence.

### 3. DESIGN REVIEW

Vet the plan through the relevant role playbooks *before* building. Catching a
misconceived approach here costs minutes; catching it after implementation costs the
implementation.

See `02-role-reviews.md` for which roles engage at which tier. Reviews at this stage read
the plan and the current code, not a diff.

**Output:** Tier 1 → `project/reviews/MVX-###-design.md`. Tier 2 → findings
summarised in the response and in the worklog entry's **Reviews** section. Tier 3 → the
one role the surface selects, in a line; often that line is "no role's surface touched".

**A Block here stops the work.** Revise the plan and re-review, or escalate to a human.

### 4. BUILD

- Implement to the plan. If reality forces a deviation, say so explicitly and record it
  — a plan quietly abandoned mid-build is how untraceable systems are made.
- Write tests alongside the change, including failure and rejection paths.
- Keep the change scoped to the ID. Unrelated improvements become new backlog rows.
- Update any `project/` artifact the change falsifies, in the same change.

### 5. VERIFY

Run the checks the charter names, in the order given by `04-quality-gates.md`. Report the
actual result.

- Use the six words in `06-evidence-and-claims.md` exactly — *Verified*, *Reported*,
  *Assumed*, *Unknown*, *Not run*, *Absent* — and no synonyms. A check that exists and you
  did not run is *Not run*, with the reason. A check the charter has no command for is
  *Absent*.
- Failing output is pasted or summarised faithfully. Never describe a failing suite as
  "mostly passing".
- For anything user-facing, verify the behaviour, not only the build: exercise the actual
  path, in the actual states (empty, loading, error, unauthorised, long content).

### 6. SHIP REVIEW

Re-run the relevant role playbooks against the *diff and the running result*, not the
plan. Different findings surface here than at design time: dead buttons, missing empty
states, copy that says something the legal review would not allow, a migration with no
down path.

**Output:** Tier 1 → `project/reviews/MVX-###-ship.md`. Tier 2 → summarised.
Tier 3 → skipped.

### 7. LOG

Append an entry to `project/worklog.md`, filling in every section of
`templates/worklog-entry.md` — that template is the required set at every tier, and
`07-traceability.md` explains why each section is there. Tier scales the length, not the
set: a Tier 3 entry is one line per section, several of them saying "none".

The worklog is prose and can be long; the backlog is a table and stays terse. Never fold
narrative into the backlog.

### 8. CLOSE

- Backlog status updated to one of the eight values in `07-traceability.md` — with a
  pointer to the worklog entry or the blocker, never a bare status change.
- New items created for everything discovered and not fixed.
- `assumptions-and-risks.md` updated: resolved entries closed, new unknowns added.
- Docs the change falsified are updated or marked `stale` (`07-traceability.md`).
- State completion plainly: what is done, what is verified, what is open.

## Waiting on a human

Parts of this kit require a person: two approvers for Tier 1 and one for Tier 2
(`05-change-control.md`), a named human for any waiver (`02-role-reviews.md`),
authorisation for anything irreversible or outward-facing. An agent running unattended
will reach those points with nobody to ask. A pull request awaiting its reviewer is one
of them — the work is `Parked`, not `Done`.

**That is a stopping condition, not an obstacle to route around.** Say so plainly rather
than downgrading the tier, splitting the work until no piece looks Tier 1, or recording
your own approval.

When you reach one:

1. **Finish everything that does not depend on the decision.** Build it, test it, review
   it. Parked work should need only the approval, not more work.
2. Set the backlog status to **`Parked`** and fill the Parked table: who is being waited
   on, for exactly what decision, and since when. "Needs review" is not a decision; "may
   we drop the legacy `session_token` column, which is unreadable after this migration"
   is.
3. Write the worklog entry now, not after approval. State what is built, what was
   verified, and what the human is deciding — including the option you recommend and why.
4. Leave the branch unmerged and say so in your closing report.

A later session resumes by reading the Parked table first: if the decision has been
recorded, continue from where the entry says the work stopped; if not, do not restart the
work, and do not re-ask if the question is already logged.

### Interrupted mid-loop

A session can also end without an answer being needed — context runs out, the user leaves.
Before you stop, the backlog status must name the loop step you actually reached
(`In progress` before VERIFY, `In review` after), and the worklog entry must exist even
if it says "incomplete — stopped after BUILD, checks not run". An item left `In progress`
with no entry is indistinguishable from an item nobody started, which is how work gets
silently done twice or not at all.

---

## Modes

The loop is the same; the emphasis differs.

### Bootstrap — a new or newly adopted project

Run the gates in `01-lifecycle-gates.md` from G0. The first deliverables are documents,
not code: charter, product brief, discovery audit (if replacing something), architecture,
and a threat model if the risk surface warrants one. Resist writing code before the
charter names the stack — that decision is an ADR, not an accident.

### Change — the normal mode

The loop as written, scaled by tier.

### Incident — something is broken in production

Order changes: **contain → diagnose → fix → verify → log → postmortem.** Process is
compressed but not skipped, and the postmortem is mandatory for S0/S1
(`templates/postmortem.md`). Never let an incident fix bypass review permanently — it
gets a retroactive review and a real backlog ID within the next working session.

### Exploration — spike, prototype, research

Timeboxed and explicitly labelled. Its output is knowledge, not shippable code. A spike
branch is never merged directly; it produces a plan or an ADR, and the real
implementation runs the full loop. Say "this is a spike" in the worklog so nobody
mistakes it for a decision.

## Deciding how much process applies

Ask, in order:

1. **Can this hurt someone or something?** (money, data, privacy, availability,
   reputation, legal exposure) → Tier 1, no exceptions.
2. **Does it change behaviour a user or another system depends on?** → Tier 2.
3. **Is it reversible in one commit with no consequence?** → Tier 3.

Two failure modes are equally bad, and the second is the more common with agents:

- **Under-process:** shipping an auth change with no review or test.
- **Over-process:** producing five review documents for a typo fix, burying real
  findings in ceremony, and exhausting the reader's attention so that the one real
  finding is skimmed.

Process is a tool for catching mistakes, not a performance of diligence.

## Working agreements

- **Read before writing.** Never rewrite a file you have not read.
- **One thing at a time.** Finish the loop for one ID before starting the next, unless
  they are genuinely independent.
- **Ask at the right time.** Do everything that does not depend on the answer first,
  then ask. Blocking with nothing delivered is for cases where any assumption could be
  unsafe or make the work useless.
- **Report faithfully.** If a step was skipped, say so. If a test fails, show it. A
  correct report of partial work is worth more than a confident report of imagined work.
- **Prefer the smallest change that fully solves the problem.** Then say what a larger
  change would have bought, and log it.
