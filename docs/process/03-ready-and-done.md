# 03 — Definition of Ready / Definition of Done

Two checklists that prevent the two most common wastes: starting work that cannot
succeed, and declaring work finished that is not.

---

## Definition of Ready

A work item may not enter BUILD until all of these are true. If one fails, the item is
`Blocked` with the reason recorded — not started optimistically.

The first four are checkable at **FRAME**, before there is a plan, and
`00-operating-model.md` checks them there. The rest depend on the plan and are checked at
**BUILD** entry. Checking the whole list at FRAME would block every item that has not been
planned yet, which is all of them.

**Checkable at FRAME:**

- [ ] **It has an ID** and a row in `project/backlog.md`.
- [ ] **The outcome is stated in one sentence** — what will be true afterwards that is
      not true now. Not "improve the dashboard" but "the dashboard shows the last
      successful sync time per report".
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria are testable**, including at least one negative case (what
      must *not* happen, or what must be refused).
- [ ] **The risk tier is assigned.**
- [ ] **Unknowns are resolved or bounded.** An unresolved unknown is either answered by
      a human, made irrelevant by a stated assumption, or the item is blocked. It is
      never silently guessed.

**Checkable at BUILD entry, once the plan exists:**

- [ ] **Dependencies are identified and satisfied**, or the item is explicitly a
      partial that stops at the dependency boundary.
- [ ] **The affected artifacts are known** — which `project/` docs this will falsify.
- [ ] **Design/plan exists** at the depth the tier requires, and has passed design
      review for Tier 1–2.
- [ ] **It is small enough to finish in one pass.** The test: it has a single stated
      outcome, and you can name every file you expect to touch. If it has two outcomes,
      or the file list is "we'll see", it is two or more items — split it, each
      independently valuable.

## Definition of Done

An item is `Done` only when all of these are true. Anything unmet is either fixed or
becomes a tracked follow-up named in the worklog entry — never an unstated gap.

### Function
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion demonstrably met, including the negative cases.
- [ ] Failure paths handled: empty, loading, error, timeout, unauthorised, forbidden,
      not-found, malformed input, concurrent action.
- [ ] No dead affordances — every control does what it appears to do, or is removed.
- [ ] No placeholder data presented as real. Placeholders are visibly labelled and
      logged.

### Quality
- [ ] Tests written and passing, covering the happy path *and* the refusals.
- [ ] The project's full check sequence run, with real output reported
      (`04-quality-gates.md`).
- [ ] No new lint/type/security-scan warnings introduced, or each one justified in
      writing.
- [ ] Performance within the budgets the charter names, where budgets exist.

### Review
- [ ] Required role reviews complete for the tier, with verdicts recorded.
- [ ] No open S0, S1, or S2 — except an S2 waived per `04-quality-gates.md`.
- [ ] Human approvals obtained where `AGENTS.md`, "Project overrides", requires them.

### Documentation
- [ ] Worklog entry appended, every section of `templates/worklog-entry.md` filled in.
- [ ] Backlog status updated; follow-ups created with IDs.
- [ ] Every `project/` artifact the change falsified is updated or marked `stale`
      (`07-traceability.md`).
- [ ] ADR written for any material decision; superseded ADRs marked, not edited.
- [ ] `assumptions-and-risks.md` reconciled — resolved entries closed, new ones added.

### Operability *(anything that deploys)*
- [ ] Configuration and secrets documented; no secret in the repository or the logs.
- [ ] Migration has a tested reverse path, or its irreversibility is explicitly accepted
      in writing.
- [ ] Observability exists for the new behaviour — you can tell from outside whether it
      is working.
- [ ] Rollback procedure stated and known to work.

## Definition of Abandoned

Rarely written down, and it should be. An item may be closed without being done when:

- the underlying need disappeared (record why);
- it was superseded by another item (link it);
- it has sat `Blocked` long enough that nobody is waiting for it any more — say since
  when, using the date in the Blocked table.

Move it to `Dropped` with a one-line reason. The row stays (`07-traceability.md`).
