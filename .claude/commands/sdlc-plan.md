description: Frame a request as a tracked work item and produce a reviewed plan
argument-hint: "<what you want built or changed>"
---

Run the FRAME → PLAN → DESIGN REVIEW steps of the loop in `AGENTS.md` for:

$ARGUMENTS

Follow `docs/process/00-operating-model.md`. Specifically:

1. **Read** `docs/project/charter.md` first — nothing else is reliable without it. If it
   is blank, fill in what you can establish from the repository (stack, commands,
   default branch) and **ask the user** for what you cannot: accountable human,
   approvers, jurisdictions, data categories, budgets. Do not invent them, and do not
   proceed past FRAME on a Tier 1 item with those blank — park it
   (`docs/process/00-operating-model.md`, "Waiting on a human"). Then read
   `docs/project/assumptions-and-risks.md`.

2. **Frame.** Restate the request in one sentence. If your restatement could plausibly
   mean something different from what was asked, ask now. Assign the next
   `{{PREFIX}}-###` — the highest number used anywhere in `docs/project/`, including
   `Dropped` rows, plus one; numbers are never reused. Classify the risk tier per "Risk
   tiers" in `AGENTS.md`, and add a terse row to `docs/project/backlog.md`. Check the
   Definition of Ready items knowable at FRAME (`docs/process/03-ready-and-done.md`) —
   if one fails, record the blocker rather than guessing past it.

3. **Plan.** Read the existing implementation before proposing anything; most bad plans
   are written against an imagined codebase. Then produce a plan from
   `docs/templates/plan.md` — Tier 1 as a file in `docs/project/plans/`, Tier 2 inline,
   Tier 3 as a sentence. Include the alternatives you rejected and the reason each lost,
   the failure modes, the rollback, and what you are deliberately not doing.

4. **Design review.** Run `/sdlc-review` against the plan. Reviews at this stage read the
   plan and the current code, not a diff.

5. **Report** the tier, the plan, the findings, and the overall verdict. If any role
   returns Block, stop and say what needs deciding — do not proceed and note it.

Do not write implementation code in this command.
